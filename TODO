The idea is that a user forks this repo and works in their fork - otherwise
the main repo would get cluttered.

Uebungen:


cherry-pick
	1. Branch A and B, pick commit x from B
	2. pick commits x-y from B

second-worktree
	A student wants you to look at their code, but you are in the middle
	of development and don't want to commit/stash change branch etc.
	You develop in two branches at the same time and don't want to do
	the commit/stash etc. dance every time.
	1. Create a second worktree

interaktive rebase
	Warn the users about the dangers of rewriting history!
	1. delete commit (internal doc leaked)
	2. split commit (internal doc2 leaked)


Hooks
	I need to explain how hooks work and what they are good for.
	Example hook: Code indentation
	1. Install the hook, modify the file "blabla.c" and try to commit it.

Filter
	I need to explain how filters work and what they are good for.
	Example filter: gitignore
	1. Install filter and write code in blabla.c. Additionally, write
		some output and comment it with // gitignore


bisect
	I need to understand what git bisect does and think of a use case
